-- | Copy a file or directory. The directory can have contents. Like `cp -r`.
copy :: FilePath -> FilePath -> Aff Unit
copy = compose toAffE <<< runEffectFn2 fs.copy

-- | Ensures that a directory is empty. Deletes directory contents if the
-- | directory is not empty. If the directory does not exist, it is created. The
-- | directory itself is not deleted.
emptyDir :: FilePath -> Aff Unit
emptyDir = toAffE <<< runEffectFn1 fs.emptyDir

-- | Ensures that the directory exists. If the directory structure does not exist,
-- | it is created. Like `mkdir -p`.
ensureDir :: FilePath -> Aff Unit
ensureDir = toAffE <<< runEffectFn1 fs.ensureDir

-- | Ensures that the file exists. If the file that is requested to be created is
-- | in directories that do not exist, these directories are created. If the file
-- | already exists, it is **NOT MODIFIED**.
ensureFile :: FilePath -> Aff Unit
ensureFile = toAffE <<< runEffectFn1 fs.ensureFile

-- | Ensures that the link exists. If the directory structure does not exist, it
-- | is created.
ensureLink :: FilePath -> FilePath -> Aff Unit

-- | Ensures that the symlink exists. If the directory structure does not exist,
-- | it is created.
ensureSymlink :: FilePath -> FilePath -> Aff Unit

-- | Moves a file or directory, even across devices.
move :: FilePath -> FilePath -> Aff Unit
move = compose toAffE <<< runEffectFn2 fs.move

-- | Almost the same as `writeFile` (i.e. it
-- | [overwrites](http://pages.citebite.com/v2o5n8l2f5reb)), except that if the
-- | parent directory does not exist, it's created.
outputFile :: FilePath -> Buffer -> Aff Unit
outputFile = compose toAffE <<< runEffectFn2 fs.outputFile

-- | Test whether or not the given path exists by checking with the file system.
-- | Like
-- | [`fs.exists`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsfsexistspathcallback), but
-- | with a normal callback signature (err, exists). Uses `fs.access` under the
-- | hood.
pathExists :: FilePath -> Aff Boolean
pathExists = toAffE <<< runEffectFn1 fs.pathExists

-- | Removes a file or directory. The directory can have contents. If the path
-- | does not exist, silently does nothing. Like `rm -rf`.
